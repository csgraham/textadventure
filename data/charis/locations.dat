1;Cemetery;"You are standing in an empty, desolate field, littered with old, worn gravestones, long since weathered by wind and rain. There is a path to the east that leads to a old, stone mausoleum, halfway into a nearby, shadowed copse. To the south, you can see an old, wooden shack, with a single sputtering candle in the window.";1;;0,2,3,0
2;Mausoleum;"The mausoleum is damp, dark, and smells of rotting wet dog. You feel a slight squish beneath you as you enter, and do not dare to look to closely at your feet. As you look around, you notice one corner darker than the rest. In that corner is a grotesque, hungry looking hellhound. Bloody saliva drips from its long sharp fangs as it looks you up and down and smiles. There is one door behind you.";;1;0,0,0,1 
3;Shack;"As you enter through the door into the shack, you see cobwebs hanging in every corner of the room. There is a fireplace against one wall, embers glowing faintly. Fortunately, the candle in the window does not provide enough light to completely illuminate the old crone sitting by the fire. You uncontrollably shudder and retreat a step as she smiles up at you with a toothless grin.";;2;1,0,0,0
